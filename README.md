# Image ‚û°Ô∏è Game of life

This project loads a PNG image, converts it to a binary form and plays [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) on it.

## What this program does

<td>Load PNG image - Use <i>libpng</i></td><td>Turn it to binary form</td>

## Run Game of life

This program implements two version os Game of Life (GoL)

### Standard GoL

[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) with some patterns colored for better visibility.

### Custom GoL

Custom algorithm adds concept of stars which can explode. This brings more activity to the standard algorithm.  
When star explores, it turns its surrounding to a random state.

There are two types of stars

* Small Star
    * Visualised in orange üü†
    * One line consists of 3 cells
    * Star explodes randomly
    
* Big star
    * Visualised in red üî¥
    * Consists of 3 separate lines
    * Star explodes randomly
    



<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="./examples/small_to_big.gif"></td><td><img src="./examples/standard_example.gif"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Custom GoL</b> - Image shows small star (orange) in the middle of the screen exploding and turning into a big star (red) which later explodes too.</td>
<td><b>Standard GoL</b> - Small and Big stars remains stable</td>
</tr>
</table>


### Comparison of standard and custom GoL

2724 steps has been generated from the same starting image shown above.

## CLI interface

```
Usage: img2gol INPUT_IMAGE PATTERNS_DIR OUTPUT_DIR NUM_STEPS SOLVER

Program that loads a PNG image, converts it to a binary form and runs Game of Life on it.

Arguments:
INPUT_IMAGE             - PNG file to be loaded. Can be RGB or RGBA
PATTERNS_DIR            - Directory where are stored pattern files provided with the software
OUTPUT_DIR              - Directory where will be stored files of each step of Game of Life
NUM_STEPS               - How many steps program should run Game of Life
SOLVER                  - 0 for standard Conway's Game of Life. 1 for Custom Game of Life algorithm

Custom Game of Life algorithm :
Custom Game of Life algorithm runs standard Conway's Game of Life with new concept of stars.
Star is a repeating pattern in shape of a star. There are two types of stars in my algorithm.
Star can explode at any time. When star explodes it changes its surrounding to a random state.
